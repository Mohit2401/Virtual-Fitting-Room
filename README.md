# Virtual-Fitting-Room
A virtual dressing room is the online equivalent of an in-store changing room. It enables shoppers to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically.

The code is written in C++ integrated with OpenCV library to implement image processing functionalities. The only limitation to the code is the user alone has to stand at a fixed length from the camera.
